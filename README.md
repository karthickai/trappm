# TraPPM: a Training Characteristics Performance Predictive Model using Semi-supervised Learning

#### Abstractâ€”As the computational demand for deep learning models steadily increases, it has become paramount to accurately predict training characteristics such as training time and memory usage. Predicted values are vital for efficient hardware allocation. Previously, performance prediction tasks have solely relied on supervised approaches. In our work, we harness the strengths of both unsupervised and supervised learning to achieve enhanced accuracy. We introduce TraPPM, a Training characteristics Performance Predictive Model that employs an unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) technique to understand graph representations from unlabeled deep learning models. The learned representation is then integrated with a supervised GNN-based performance regressor to forecast training characteristics.
